# Patient Data Acquisition Web App (Complete Scaffold)

This is a fuller scaffold implementing the Patient Data Acquisition Web App with:
- Full views, templates, login/logout, session detail with interactive chart.
- MQTT publisher (on measurement start) and improved ingestion command `run_mqtt`.
- CSV/XLSX export endpoints.
- Admin registrations.

The implementation was derived from the user's uploaded PDF specification provided earlier. Use the supplied management command `run_mqtt` to ingest device data from MQTT.
